                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    I was the UI/UX designer and programmer for a 3 person team working in Godot (GDscript).
                    <br><br>
                    This was a project created by me and two friends with the goal of messing around with Godot after
                    the whole Unity debacle.
                    We decided to create a basic idle game that revolved around growing plants in planter boxes that you
                    could then harvest and sell for more money.
                    The idea is that each plant has different costs, sell values, and grow times and the core gameplay
                    would be based on increasing the amount and value of the plants you can grow while managing losses
                    from disease and wild animals.
                    The unique selling point (USP) of our game was that you would unlock new plants with special
                    abilities like disease protection or growth rate aura and the player would have to manage plating
                    beneficial buffs vs plants that are valuable.
                </p>
                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I was the UI/UX developer and gameplay balancer for this project. This work involved many tasks
                    such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing UI</li>
                    <li>Programming UI/UX for menus (buy, sell, and upgrade)</li>
                    <li>Defining different seed types and abilities</li>
                    <li>Creating and managing balance of game economy</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
