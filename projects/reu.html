                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Suspense is an important emotion for the enjoyment of games. Various methods have been proposed to
                    manage suspense in games. Most existing works focus on managing suspense via storytelling or
                    artifacts, such as sound effects. However, little work has been done in studying how to use gameplay
                    to manage suspense. In this paper, we present a study in which we developed a horror-adventure game
                    with a built-in suspense manager based on adaptive gameplay. We conducted a small user study to
                    evaluate the effect of dynamic suspense management on game players. Our results showed that gameplay
                    could potentially be used to manage the level of suspense experienced by players, independent of the
                    story and artifacts in the game. The work discussed in our paper provides game designers with
                    new tools for suspense management in non-narrative-based games.

                <h2>My Role</h2>
                <p>
                    I was one of the game developer, testers, and presenters for this project. This work involved many
                    tasks such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing and devloping a horror game</li>
                    <li>Implementing our proposed suspense management system into the game</li>
                    <li>Performing tests and collecting data on our system</li>
                    <li>Putting together presentation material</li>
                    <li>Writting research paper</li>
                    <li>Presenting our findings at conventions</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
